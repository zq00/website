abstract: Welcome, Data Science for Social Good mentors!  I'm excited that you are committed to spending the next few months mentoring students on a data science project with positive social impact. Your guidance are crucial to the success of the project and your studentsâ€™ growth as a data scientist. Besides being an engaging learning experience for the fellows and enhancing data analysis capacity for the project partner, Data Science for Social Good program (DSSG) also provides an opportunity for you to grow as a mentor, teacher and project manager. I prepared this guide as a starting point for you to design your mentoring experience. This guide consists of three sections on mentoring, project management and teaching. I explain relevant concepts, discuss strategies, and provide resources where you can learn more about each topic. I also invite you to reflect on your own experiences or design materials you can use during DSSG.
