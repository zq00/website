abstract: Recent development of interactive programming (e.g., R markdown, Jupiter notebook) has allowed researchers to write a reproducible data analysis report, where code chunk, descriptions, and references are integrated in a single file. This approach offers multiple advantages; for example, it simplifies experimentation, enhances reproducibility and makes it easier to share your research. At the same time, writing a reproducible report also benefits from good coding practices. In this talk, I will share a few challenges I encounter when writing a manuscript in R markdown, and some thoughts and tips I found along the way.
